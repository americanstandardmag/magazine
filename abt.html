            <p>Hello, my name is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/traejenhall/">Traejen "Trae" Hall</a>. I grew up in the quiet town of Chariton, Iowa, and my childhood gave me an appreciation for many things: one’s labor, the land, our natural world, what it means to be in a community. My politics could broadly be described as left-of-center, and I believe that we are at our best when we work together. I have an associate’s degree in liberal arts from Des Moines Area Community College and a bachelor’s degree in American politics and minors in environmental policy and history. Much of my professional career thus far has been in electoral politics and state government, working as a campaign manager for three candidates and a legislative assistant for a state senator. I look forward to writing with my good friends and colleagues here at the <em>American Standard</em>.</p>

            <p> Hi! I am <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/klinkeandrew/">Andrew Klinke</a>. I live in Madison, Wisconsin, better known as a liberal theme park surrounded by a sea of Midwestern reality. I have two Bachelor degrees from Drake University one in International Relations and the other in International Business. I am most passionate about Transit and Urban planning, however I will write the occasional piece on foreign relations. I have a borderline autistic level of knowledge of all things to do with Train that I am excited to bring to the <em>American Standard</em>!</p>

            <p>My name is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/grant-morgan-b1a300206/">Grant Morgan</a> and I am a staff writer at the <em>American Standard</em> who is based in Washington, DC. I originally grew up in Southern Illinois and attended Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa for my BA in political science. I then, like a fool, proceeded to get my MA in international affairs during a moment of unprecedented global change. When I’m not thinking about history books or fun little musical parodies, I am likely networking and exploring all the wonderful spots in DC I can find. My writing interests are mainly focused on US foreign policy and international economics, but I like to explore and read about a little bit of everything.

            <p>My name is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholas-trout-33527a233/">Nicholas Trout</a>. I live in Silver Spring, Maryland after spending most of my life in Iowa. I have a Bachelor’s degree from Drake University in Politics and International Relations and a Master’s degree in Security Policy Studies from George Washington University. My interests are US foreign policy, election analysis, and local politics. I hope that my experience living in the Heartland and inside the Beltway gives me a unique perspective on the key issues facing our country, and I am excited to bring my perspective to the <em>American Standard</em>.</p>
