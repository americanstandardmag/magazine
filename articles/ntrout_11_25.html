    <p>&emsp;The first general election day of the second Trump term is quickly approaching this Tuesday on November 4th. While the New York City Mayoral Election and statewide contests in Virginia and New Jersey have received the most attention, plenty of local offices and referenda are on the ballot <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://boltsmag.org/whats-on-the-ballot/2025-general-election/">across the country</a>. These less-covered races will offer insights into the mood of the electorate as the first year of the second Trump Administration comes to a close.</p>
    <p><b>Mayoral Races Test Strength of Democratic Party Factions</b></p>
    <p>&emsp;Like in New York City, many cities around the country have mayoral elections that will test the relative strength of the Progressive and Moderate wings of the Democratic Party. These races come as the party and its national leadership are <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/trackers/the-democratic-party-favorability">increasingly unpopular</a>, and will serve as tests of whether this frustration leads to defeats of candidates aligned with the party establishment. Key mayoral races to watch under this lens include Minneapolis, Jersey City, and Seattle.</p>
    <p>&emsp;In Minneapolis, Progressive candidate and Minnesota Senate member Omar Fateh is hoping to unseat incumbent Mayor Jacob Frey. Mayor Frey gained national attention after the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020 and the protests and civil unrest which followed. Frey weathered a challenge from the party's left-wing flank in 2021, and is now seeking election to a third term. Debates over public safety and homelessness have been central to the race, with Fateh and other candidates <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-mayor-election-candidate-issues/601512515">criticizing</a> Frey's clearing of homeless encampments and perceived lack of action on police reform. The campaign has also been characterized by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://sahanjournal.com/democracy-politics/racism-islamophobia-attacks-minnesota-election/">race-based attacks</a> regarding Fateh's Somali heritage. Given Frey's strong support from Minnesota's Democratic establishment, a surprise defeat would send a strong signal that voters are more interested in change than stability heading into the 2026 midterms.</p>
    <p>&emsp;Across the river from New York City, former New Jersey Governor Jim McGreevy has received the backing of the Democratic Party establishment in a race for Jersey City Mayor. Governor McGreevy is facing a trio of Progressive candidates, and with no candidate currently polling close to 50%, a runoff election between the top two vote-getters is likely. While polling indicates McGreevey is likely to advance to the December 2nd runoff, it is unclear which left-wing candidate he will be facing. Former President of the Jersey City Board of Education Mussab Ali has gained attention online for running a Zohran Mamdani-inspired campaign focused on affordability and expansion of municipal services, and has received endorsements from national Progressive politicians like Rep. Ro Khanna and Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison. Ali is competing for the Progressive vote with two other major candidates, including Jersey City Councilmember James Solomon, who has the backing of the New Jersey Working Families Party and the Sen. Bernie Sanders-aligned Our Revolution PAC. Meanwhile, County Commissioner Bill O'Dea has received the backing of a slate of local organized labor groups.</p>
    <p>&emsp;Seattle politics in the modern era have been defined by competition between the Moderate and Progressive wings of the Democratic Party. The Mayor's office has been particularly volatile, as no Mayor has won a second term since 2005. Incumbent Mayor Bruce Harrell, aligned with the Moderate faction, is hoping to break this trend on November 4th. Harrell faces Progressive candidate and public transportation advocate Katie Wilson, who received the most votes in the nonpartisan primary election. The election has been defined by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://boltsmag.org/seattle-mayoral-race-tensions-over-homelessness-harrell-wilson/">debates over homelessness and housing policy</a>, and polling indicates Wilson has a slight edge heading into election day. Along with the concurrent City Council elections, the race for the Mayor's office will determine which of Seattle's political factions holds power for the remainder of the second Trump term.</p>
    <p>&emsp;Along with the election in New York City, the results of these mayoral races will provide a clearer window into how dissatisfaction among Democratic voters will affect future elections. Will voters seek stability from Moderate establishment-aligned candidates, or is the base ready to chart a new, more Progressive path?</p>
    <p><b>Battle for Partisan Control in Nassau County</b></p>
    <p>&emsp;While intraparty battles define many local races this year, some jurisdictions will still provide insights into how the general public may have shifted since President Trump's second inauguration. One of these key bellwethers will be Nassau County, New York, where voters will elect their County Executive, Prosecutor, and County Legislature. All three of these institutions are currently held by Republicans, as Nassau County has shifted to the right in the Trump era. </p>
    <p>&emsp;The county-wide race for Executive and Prosecutor will provide key insights into how Long Island's electorate has shifted since the 2024 election. Republicans captured both offices in 2021, with the race for Executive being decided by just 2,200 votes. Democrats are hoping that backlash to the second Trump administration will provide an opening to flip these offices back to their control and undo the rightward shift the county has experienced since 2016. Republicans currently enjoy a 12-7 majority in the Nassau County Legislature, but a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://lwvofpwm.org/update-final-redistricting-map-of-nassau-county/">newly-drawn electoral map</a> has eliminated the previous Republican geographic advantage, setting up a hotly contested election on November 4th. While some Democratic gains are expected given the new district boundaries, a change in partisan control in the County Legislature may indicate that the rightward trend in the county has softened considerably.</p>
    <p><b>Local Funding Measures</b></p>
    <p>&emsp;As federal grants have been slashed and local jurisdictions are increasingly strapped for cash, cities, counties, and school districts across the country are turning to voters to close budget deficits and raise funds for capital improvements. In most cases, these ballot initiatives ask voters to approve increases to property and sales taxes or authorize the issuing of bonds in order to cover costs. Cities such as Columbus and Denver are asking voters to authorize large bond packages for a range of projects and departments, while school districts across the country seek funding mechanisms to close budget deficits and fund improvements. City officials in Columbus Ohio are seeking a substantial <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.columbus.gov/News-articles/City-of-Columbus-Proposes-1.9-Billion-Bond-Package-to-Finance-Affordable-Housing-Police-and-Fire-Stations-Sidewalks-Parks-and-Other-Infrastructure">$1.9 billion bond package</a> to finance a diverse range of projects including parks, affordable housing, and public utilities. As one of the largest bond packages in the city's history, the success of these measures will have a significant impact on the future of Columbus' development plans. In another large funding measure, Denver officials are asking voters to approve the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.denvergov.org/Government/Citywide-Programs-and-Initiatives/GO-Bonds/2025-Vibrant-Denver-Bond/Whats-Included-in-the-Vibrant-Denver-Bond">Vibrant Denver Bond package</a>, worth $950 Million, to fund construction and improvement projects throughout the city. If passed, these bonds would help fund expansions of parks and affordable housing while transforming major corridors to improve walkability and transportation efficiency.</p>
    <p>&emsp;Several large school districts are seeking to raise funds for operations and improvements to educational facilities. Jurisdictions in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/education/2025/09/16/des-moines-school-board-approves-reimagining-education-bond-question-for-ballot/86179148007/?gnt-cfr=1&gca-cat=p&gca-uir=true&gca-epti=z116946p119150c119150d00----v116946b0055xxd005565&gca-ft=157&gca-ds=sophi&sltsgmt=0154_C">Des Moines</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.aps.edu/capital-master-plan/2025-capital-election">Albuquerque</a>, and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.fcps.edu/bond2025">Fairfax</a> are voting on packages worth hundreds of millions of dollars to fund new construction and renovations of their schools. Staying true to “everything is bigger in Texas” several Texan school districts are seeking to fund substantial capital improvements, with Richardson ISD in Dallas considering an eye-popping <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://web.risd.org/home/bond2025/#bond">$1.4 billion bond package</a> to fund construction projects at six junior high schools and a new Career and Technical Education Center. These bond questions, along with other smaller measures, will be key to future planning for schools across the country.</p>
    <p><b>The Bottom Line</b></p>
    <p>&emsp;The down ballot elections on November 4th will reveal how the electorate has shifted during the first year of the second Trump administration. They will test the strength of the factions within the Democratic Party and demonstrate how voters' opinions about the two parties may have changed in the past year. Election day will also be critical for local jurisdictions around the country attempting to raise funds for capital improvements and maintaining stable budgets in an environment where governments are increasingly short on cash.
