    <h3>Give Des Moines a Chance!</h3>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><em>by Trae Hall</em></p>
    <!--article contents: for each paragraph, tabbed in and separated slightly-->
    <p>&emsp;Every year, the coming of autumn reminds me of why I love living in Des Moines, Iowa. Yes, I enjoy all of the things that come with the climate of the Midwest - the change of temperatures, the smell of home fireplaces that linger out to the sidewalks, foliage that rivals our friends' in New England. But the real reason I love autumn in Des Moines is the sense of community that radiates out from my neighbors this time of year.</p>
    <p>&emsp;Truth be told, I'm not a stranger to many neighborhoods in my city, as I find myself helping out local candidates and all sorts of other progressive causes practically every year. One thing I've been able to piece together in the literal thousands of conversations I've been lucky to have with voters over time is a true profile of my community. Des Moines is, of course, the largest city in Iowa and operates as our state capital. Most folks from outside our borders have probably pretended or have been forced to care about us every four years for one or both of the presidential caucuses. But contrary to the belief of our detractors, people do in fact live in Des Moines between elections.</p>
    <p>&emsp;It's a city I've called home for more than five years.</p>
    <p>&emsp;Now, I refuse to wax poetic about some fictionalized Mayberry version of Des Moines. We certainly have our issues, many of which are perpetuated by the Iowa Legislature. Others are much more workable. We need to seriously address the rising rate of homelessness in Polk County. And as the principal city of the metro, Des Moines has to lead on solutions to this issue. Presently, a majority on the Des Moines City Council have chosen <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.iowapublicradio.org/ipr-news/2025-10-21/des-moines-city-council-camping-ban-homeless-encampments">more punitive measures</a>, such as fines or other citations, instead of a housing-first approach. Not only does this not properly address the issue of why folks are sleeping on the street, it is nothing much more than a reactionary policy to make a poor argument that the city is doing something at all. Our community would be much better off if we chose to spend our time and limited resources uplifting our nonprofit partners who have a track record of success, while providing a backstop for newer organizations with sound plans but few funds. </p>
    <p>&emsp;At the same time, Des Moines is a metro with a bright future. It is currently the fastest-growing metro in the Midwest, and will likely join the list of American metros with more than one million people over the next 15 years. Even more surprisingly, the Des Moines metro alone accounts for roughly <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/evolving-american-cities/2025/06/12/des-moines-metro-leads-midwest-in-growth-evolving-america/83202613007/">85 percent of the population increases for the State of Iowa</a>. At a time when the majority of the state is unfortunately losing residents, Des Moines remains a strong place to call home. This is driven primarily by the fact that Des Moines retains solid employment growth, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.datadsmusa.com/index">which has been 18 percent over the past ten years</a>. Few other metros in Iowa or even across the Midwest have seen competing figures.</p>
    <p>&emsp;There is much to appreciate economically as well for younger hires. Des Moines provides a landing pad for those who are leaving our colleges and universities. When compared to other midwestern metro areas, Des Moines offers a reasonable cost of living while enjoying an increasing number of amenities. My peers have often remarked to me after moving from much more expensive cities how much farther their paycheck goes in Des Moines. And at a time when the country is likely headed for a steep recession, particularly among Gen Z, and the rest of the State of Iowa struggles to perform economically, any financial flexibility is irreplaceable.</p>
    <p>&emsp;While still out of reach for too many, Des Moines is also making strides on housing. For the first time in the city's history, Des Moines has adopted a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cms2.revize.com/revize/cityofdesmoines/Documents/Government/Strategic%20Efforts/Housing/DSMCitywideStrategy_czb2025.pdf?t=202508260850400&t=202508260850400">comprehensive housing strategy</a>. Do I think the strategy addresses every aspect of our housing needs? I do not. But I do think that it represents a sobriety about the issue that hasn't before been seen at the at the municipal level. It first takes stock of what is available for families who are planning a move to the metro within Des Moines versus what our suburban friends are offering. It then provides suggestions of how to grow and improve.</p>
    <p>&emsp;Unlike our suburban neighbors, Des Moines must simultaneously build new housing while keeping our existing housing stock from deteriorating. While the city has traditionally avoided much of the deindustrialization of larger midwestern metropoles due to our concentration of agricultural and insurance firms, many neighborhoods have remained stagnant over the past few decades. Replicating the suburbs is both economically and physically untenable. This means we must invest in a greater diversity of housing types; neighborhoods should be of gentle, mixed density - as they all used to be! Not only does this allow for affordability, it ensures vibrant neighborhood character as residents may choose to expand or scale down their living spaces to fit the needs of their stage in life.</p>
    <p>&emsp;Setting our community up for success is going to require a vision for what the city can and should be. We have every reason to want to capture a good portion of the growth occurring in the broader metro. That means playing to Des Moines' strengths. For our friends unfamiliar with Des Moines, it means expanding on the walkability that we do enjoy in pockets, and continuing to diversify our entertainment while bolstering alternative transit options. I would be hard pressed to find another apartment unit like the one I currently enjoy downtown in any other city for the same price. I personally enjoy the fact that I can see the scoreboard of our baseball stadium from my balcony.</p>
    <p>&emsp;But in order to create more housing opportunities like the one I have, we must do things differently. In addition to our baseball stadium, I also see acres of surface-level parking when I glance out of my window - much of which sits empty even during business hours. Even in recent years, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.axios.com/local/des-moines/2024/01/29/downtown-parking-lots-central-business-district">more than a quarter</a> of our downtown land has been stubbornly covered under parking. The truth is that our priorities as a community have changed, whether we are ready to recognize that or not. Gone are the days when one could argue these lots were necessary as officeworkers flowed in and out of downtown. It is more of a neighborhood than ever before. </p>
    <p>&emsp;So while my pleas are primarily angled towards prospective residents, I would also like to implore my current neighbors to give Des Moines a chance. We are very much at an inflection point. We can choose to continue to welcome new families, not just socially in the “Iowa nice” sense, but with quality human services and forward-thinking development. There is still so much of what has always made our community worth living in still intact. At the same time, we are going to be confronted with serious challenges over the next generation that will force us to think differently. We should welcome this just as we welcome new neighbors. For better or for worse, we're no longer a small town - but that doesn't mean we can't feel like one. </p>
