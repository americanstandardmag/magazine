    <p>&emsp;We need to make it easier to be an American.  Despite current circumstances, I am not saying we need to make it easier for one to *become* an American, to come here and put down roots - though I do believe that, and it is an important discussion to engage with. No, we need to make it easier for American citizens-the lifeblood of our nation, recipients of this sacred fire of liberty, proud defenders of freedom, or just Susan from around the corner-to go about their lives and interact with their society in a way that doesn't make them want to pull their hair out.  Specifically, we need to make it easier for folks to be Americans by easing the strain of interacting with the one thing that really unites all Americans together, our government and the principles of democracy and individual liberty it is supposed to represent.  We need to override the tendency to create systems that make people whole-heartedly believe the witticism that Reagan popularized (though likely did not create), "the nine most terrifying words in the English language are: I'm from the Government, and I'm here to help".  We need to do a lot of things, so why is this so important?</p>
    <p>&emsp;The world has become a staggeringly convoluted place, full of intractably complex problems.  One could argue that it has always been so, but what is far more recent is that we have developed suitably intricate solutions. The internet, and the accessibility of information-both accurate and not-that it brings means that this complexity is no longer abstracted away, and that social contract has crumbled, through both deliberate sabotage and an inability to adapt.  In the past, we built the Interstate highway system and connected the country like never before (if one conveniently ignores the nearly 430,000 km of track that had been laid in the US by the close of WW1).  We developed vaccines that <ins>eradicated</ins> one of the deadliest diseases to ever exist. Nowadays, a wildfire happens somewhere in the Pacific West and, because your insurance provider has a national presence, your premium goes up for seemingly no reason at all.  Your neighbor desperately needs a lung transplant to survive, but they weren't sure whether they should get vaccinated against COVID and now aren't a suitable recipient when the registry looks to distribute organs.  These are the end results of complex solutions to evolving, modern problems, but they are confusing, and they are opaque.  The system doesn't look like it's working (and, to be fair, it often either is not or is working all too well for just a few). A lack of understanding breeds fear and resentment, and before long that spirals into retrenchment on the core democratic ideals of our country begins to take hold. This is not to say that we need to train everyone to be actuaries.  Good lord, what a horribly dull place the world would become.  But we do need ways to engage with the average person, provide avenues for understanding and convenient on-ramps for interaction with all these logistical marvels that we’ve concocted to deal with things like risk, healthcare, and the day to day functioning of the most powerful government in the history of humankind.</p>
    <p>&emsp;These imposed difficulties are commonly referred to as 'Administrative Burden', a phrase that has been making its way around discussions of policy for a while but (I believe) was most persuasively defined and tied to the lives of average people, in Pamela Herd and Don Moynihan's excellent 2018 book, "Administrative Burden: Policymaking by Other Means".  I'm expanding the term slightly here, and tying in concepts from systems science, usability, and engineering, in an effort to convince you that not only should we want a government of the people, by the people, and for the people, but we should want a government that is easy for people to work with.  Let's take a brief look at the kind of struggles we're facing.</p>
    <p>&emsp;In mid-2024, the Brennan Center published findings showing nearly 4 million Americans may not have any access to documents proving their citizenship.  That is a massive number, so our scope already seems monumental.  But dig a bit deeper, and the problem only grows.  At base level, let's say that none of these 4 million Americans can drive, since they can't sufficiently prove their identity to obtain a license.  Already a large problem, potentially pulling millions of people out of the workforce because they can't secure transit to their jobs, and putting them at risk of health care issues when they can't attend preventative care appointments or transport themselves to a hospital for a procedure.  But then lets consider that, for example, 1/4 of those Americans are parents, and they have the US-average 1.9 children in their families.  Now, not only do they likely experience difficulties in employment, but they have to think about filing for SNAP to put food on the table.  Can't do that without being a citizen, and how exactly are they going to prove that?  Suddenly the impacted population is more like 6 million, and so the number grows.  This doesn't even touch on the impact to voting rights that the Center was focussed on. Vital records can be re-obtained, assuming that, depending on the state, you have things like a permanent address.  But it's yet another step in what's already a draining process.  Little surprise that so many people still lack these documents.  And helping one person acquire proof of citizenship via a clinic or aid organization, while hopefully life-altering for them, does little to cure the issue writ large.  Situations like this suffuse the lives of millions of Americans, and just like with our lucky citizen, fixing the problem for each person as it arises is grossly inefficient. What if we thought about it a different way?</p>
    <p>&emsp;By their nature, these complex systems are comprised of so many sub-units that a change in the individual subunit doesn't change the outcome of the system.  As we said above, helping one person does not the problem resolve. However, changing the interactions between components, or the mechanism by which they are selected, can create a massive difference.  This disproportionate impact is the key to designing policies that promote civic engagement, because not only does changing the mechanism have larger outcomes, but people can *feel* that interactions are different.  Let's take as a case-study the IRS Direct File program, one of a multitude of government initiatives that is on track to meet an early demise after a promising start.  Instituted using funds from the Inflation Reduction Act, the Direct File program is notable, to me, in that it actively seeks to make interaction with the federal government *easier* without relying on the removal of regulations or processes.  The Direct File program was available in 12 states during the 2024 tax filing season, and 25 states in 2025.  It allowed certain individuals who met income and other requirements to directly, electronically file their taxes with the IRS. Over the course of the pilot, over 150,000 Americans engaged with the program, and roughly 10% subsequently filled out surveys detailing their experiences.  The results were impressive.  The Treasury Department estimates that filers saved over $5.5 million in fees.  90% of participants rated their experience as 'Above Average' or better.  And perhaps most shockingly, **86%** of respondents said that the experience *increased their trust in the IRS*.  Imagine, Americans admitting that they trust the tax man.  </p>
    <p>&emsp;The key take away here is that these results came from what I had mentioned previously; not trying to force us to take a less complicated solution, like getting rid of the tax code, but instead by making it easier to work with.  The Direct File program still captured a massive amount of data, with over 1,000 discrete 'facts' that were used to ensure the return was filed accurately.  But it did so in such a way that was quick, understandable, and less burdensome for the people using it. Instead of changing the behaviour of 1 individual (doing someone's taxes for them at a free clinic), we instead changed the mechanism through which all of those individuals interact with the larger system.  It leaves them feeling empowered, more satisfied with outcomes, and helps rebuild their faith in the idea that yes, government actually can accomplish things for you.  Plus, as a nice bonus for Uncle Sam, they paid their taxes.</p>
    <p>&emsp;If the benefits weren't enough, the excessive costs of administrative burden aren't only felt by those who must navigate it; they're also experienced by those who impose it.  Georgia's 'Pathways to Coverage' is an ill-conceived experiment placing work requirements on Medicaid eligibility.  The program has cost upwards of $60 million, according to ProPublica, while disbursing less than $30 million in reimbursement for healthcare expenses.  Lo and behold, bureaucrats cost money, regardless of their political affiliation.  There are some additional costs experienced by Pathways, but without valid documentation on the breakdown of those costs it is hard to gauge their negative impact.  And the point still stands. By directing their efforts towards making sure the 'wrong people' don't have access to benefits, we reduce our capacity to provide benefits in the first place.  If we're spending money on means-testing, we're spending less money on those with little means.  Everything has a cost, and embracing more complicated, obtuse policies just introduces greater expense and reduced benefits.</p>
    <p>&emsp;When leaders get up and say that they're fighting for a government that works 'for the people', we should hold them to a far more literal interpretation.  When they talk about a creating change, take it a step further.  Push them to prioritize designing these regulations and processes so that small, local interactions can both be positive for participants and integrate seamlessly into the larger system.  We need to help onramp people into an ever more complex world, and give them mechanisms to have a real impact on both their own lives and the direction of the country. Mechanisms put together in such a way that using them doesn't leave people so frustrated and confused that they retrench entirely on the social values that we claim to value in this country.  When done right, it can renew their trust in institutions that they may have felt abandoned by in the past. When talking about the work it takes to pass on values and preserve our society, John Dewey said it extremely well: "this renewal is not automatic. Unless pains are taken to see that genuine and thorough transmission takes place, the most civilized group will relapse into barbarism and then into savagery."  Of course we must take pains to ensure that our ideals are transmitted, and that society continues to function for those who comprise it.  But we don't need to make it so damn hard for ourselves.</p>
