    <h3>The Vibes Based Order With Trumpian Characteristics</h3>
    <P>A story about DC’s young foreign policy professionals, their reactions to the Trump administration, and where they see things going in the future.</P>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><em>by Grant Morgan</em></p>
    <!--article contents: for each paragraph, tabbed in and separated slightly-->
    
    <p>&emsp;To what extent US foreign policy flows from up democratic channels is up for debate. After all, foreign policy is rarely within the top ten things that <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/651719/economy-important-issue-2024-presidential-vote.aspx">voters</a> worry about in their daily activities. Normal people, or those not infatuated with overseas conflicts and transcripts from diplomatic meetings, worry about bread-and-butter issues, and what is often directly in front of them. The economy, healthcare, transportation, childcare, housing, wages, and maybe even the prices of local happy hours are all much more important and ubiquitously felt than, say, the war in Ukraine or a United Nations General Assembly hearing. We, quite naturally, are worried about our own backyard, about our own little slice of community where we're theoretically able to vote, organize, and make an active difference.</p>
    <p>&emsp;Of course, this same democratic ideal of making a political and social difference, which years prior helped us make positive gains in a variety of areas, has a history of opposing events overseas too. Our war in Vietnam continued for years despite numerous protests being held, and despite countless attempts by hippies to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/how-rag-tag-group-acid-dropping-activists-tried-levitate-pentagon-180965338/">levitate</a> the Pentagon for peace. </p>
    <p>&emsp;Subsequent protests in the 21st century, such as those around America’s wars in the Middle East, also failed to prevent the conflicts or bring our troops home from the emerging quagmires. In 2024, we again saw this conundrum emerge, this time in opposition to Israel’s actions in Gaza. Hundreds of thousands spoke out, organized, and tried their best to shift our country’s politics against institutions which were much larger than themselves, and which existed in far flung areas of the world littered with contention. It was in essence, a broad continuation of that democratic ideal which has existed since our country’s founding, an attempt at politically reinforcing our right to democratically shape our country’s behavior, person by person and protest by protest. But sadly, these attempts largely failed. Foreign policy, it seemed, was largely insulated from popular will.</p>
    <p>&emsp;So, does recent history truly convey a broken form of politics that does not respect our input? Does our current moment signal to us that we are destined to be locked out of the gladiatorial football match that is US foreign policy, unable to change the game’s outcome, let alone its rules or conditions? The short answer is no. The long-form answer, which you will read in the paragraphs below…is a resounding we’ll see what can do. </p>
    <p>&emsp;This essay is not a doom story about the lack of democratic accountability for US foreign policy. Rather, it’s a story of cautious observation, of hope and fear, suffused with on-the-ground conversations in our nation’s capital which help to paint a picture, both good and bad, of how our actions and activities are changing things. Our echoes of momentum and anger are real, and those with the ability to change and shift policy have noticed. Only time will tell if our acts of protest and outrage are enough to shift our country’s policies in a far more democratic direction. But within this piece, I think the evidence is quite clear that change is indeed happening, and that it might be mounting far sooner than many in power are comfortable with. </p>
    <p><b>How To Break All the Norms</b></p>
    <p>&emsp;DC is littered with foreign policy nerds and advisors who are all itching for an opportunity to change narratives and ideas. Conferences, policy forums, cocktail hours, and, of course, article pitches, for decades have been a near-weekly occurrence which grant thousands of individuals one-on-one time with fellow nerds and political power brokers. These select individuals and networks for years were highly influential and lined up the offices of various think tanks, newspapers, universities, government departments, and political organizations.  </p>
    <p>&emsp;Certain ideas and alliances, in these milieus, also proved able to withstand both the test of time and political reality, especially in areas where large degrees of wealth were involved. For decades, various networks of foreign policy intellectuals and experts, often with the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quincyinst.org/research/defense-contractor-funded-think-tanks-dominate-ukraine-debate/">backing</a> of corporate think tanks and PACs, continuously supported American interventionism overseas, mindlessly dishing out <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.theamericanconservative.com/the-weekly-standards-war/">commentaries</a> and policy briefs which all pointed in the same hawkish and pro-war direction. These actions helped to keep us in Iraq and Afghanistan, all while concurrently supporting governmental crackdowns on civil liberties and privacy. Their kingmakers, during the heyday, were the neoconservatives, consisting of leading <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://chicagoreader.com/arts-culture/bush-and-the-neocons/">figures</a> like Dick Cheney, George W. Bush, Paul Wolfowitz, and John Bolton. Thousands of others, in much less substantial positions, followed in their footsteps. </p>
    <p>&emsp;By utilizing their connections to influential think tanks and defense industries, these figures and groups managed to develop a political agenda which meshed their foreign hawkishness with a free-market economic agenda. Free trade, deregulation, and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.epi.org/news/the-bush-tax-cuts-10-years-later-still-expensive-and-ineffective/">tax cuts</a> won the day, and were then vehemently buttressed alongside a foreign policy agenda which consisted of larger defense budgets, increased intervention, and nation building. It was an agenda which was isolated from the Republican base and democratic accountability, pleasing only those who got giddy at the site of bombs raining down while sipping on expensive cocktails and wines. </p>
    <p>&emsp;During the W. Bush and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/why-president-obama-is-a-neocon/">Obama</a> administrations, these clusters of nerds and experts never experienced much backlash or rejection. Most held onto their influential positions and continued to impact American policy apace, all while frantically spamming the same ideas and narratives which had been influential for decades. Nothing, it seemed, would fundamentally change as free trade and foreign intervention continued onward despite new administrations and Congresses. Democracy, and our various inputs, were changing very little. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/isis-rises-in-libya">Crises</a> and mistakes continued to happen abroad, and none seemed to convey a foreign policy in decline. The conclusion was already set, and now facts and events had to be molded to fit this pre-established notion, backed by money and power. </p>
    <p>&emsp;When brought to the public’s attention, most crises were quickly used as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-politics-of-the-benghazi-report">cudgels</a> to attack political rivals, such as when Republicans used the rise of ISIS and Benghazi against their Democratic opponents. No lesson was to ever be learned from our failures, and new generations of experts and opinion leaders found themselves learning this time and time again. By operating in a DC bubble where ideological ingratiation and myopic thinking were needed for both professional growth and social capital, many chose to simply adopt the safest and least combative option. Generations of people played this game, perpetuating a morbid status quo with no accountability, never once suspecting that this system was frayed and motorless. And then, by 2016, various alarm bells started ringing all at once. </p>
    <p>&emsp;Anger brewed within marginalized parts of the country. A new dictum was beginning to appear all over rust belt cities and stagnant regions of the country, and its message was rather clear: change or else. Various forces recognized this message with a passionate fervor and then tried to meet the moment. From the right came businessman Donald Trump, whose rhetoric against free trade and American intervention found much energy among a Republican base which was angry after years of neoconservative and free-market orthodoxy. In the fall of 2015, Trump seemed to be nothing but a joke to the Bush-era classes of experts and commentators, but by the same time next year, he was their party’s official nominee for president. </p>
    <p>&emsp;From the left came Bernie Sanders, the self-described democratic socialist from Vermont who promised universal programs and anti-interventionism predicated on left-wing class politics. He was simultaneously anti-free trade and anti-intervention, against both corrupt institutions at home and abroad. Among the Democratic base, Sanders found strong clusters of support from those who opposed Hiliary Clinton’s politics of the status quo and instead clamored for something economically and socially progressive.</p>
    <p>&emsp;Trump and Sanders represented dramatically different futures for American politics and its myriad of ills, but both also perfectly encompassed the country’s new political moment, defined by growing institutional decline and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://scholarlypublishingcollective.org/msup/rpa/article-abstract/22/3/343/174510/The-Populist-and-Nationalist-Roots-of-Trump-s?redirectedFrom=PDF">populist</a> sentiment. Changing conditions were leading to new ideas and resentments across the entire political spectrum, and as this occurred, respect for the government, corporations, the media, and various other orthodox avenues dropped further. Many among the bases of both parties demanded reduced conflict abroad and economic support at home, as did many new candidates running for office. Especially on the right, many began to question the fundamental tenets behind <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/persons-of-interest/bill-kristol-wanders-the-wilderness-of-trump-world">neoconservatism</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.aei.org/articles/tucker-carlson-and-the-republican-turn-against-the-market/">free-market</a> fundamentalism, actively challenging the series of core political principles which just 15 years prior had helped George W. Bush win reelection.</p>
    <p>&emsp;Trump, of course, still often governed hawkishly, just look at his Iran policy for an example of this. But rhetorically, this fact was never conveyed. Trump’s reelection campaign was economically nationalist and deeply skeptical of global and domestic institutions. Noticeably, Trump continued to run like an <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/articles/donald-trump-fought-the-establishment-and-won/">anti-establishment</a> candidate, despite the fact that he was the incumbent president. And while he ultimately lost in 2020, Trump’s insurgent, anti-international streak never ended. </p>
    <p>&emsp;Four years later, Trump was able to win reelection, beating a Democratic administration which had promised global stability and delivered the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/state-of-the-order-continuing-challenges-to-the-world-order-raise-the-urgency-for-gaza-ceasefire-and-ukraine-aid/">opposite</a>. Crises in Ukraine and Gaza sullied a large part of the debate around the Biden administration’s competency, as did an economic recovery from Covid which was littered with inflation and imbalanced gains. In its totality, Biden’s presidency was nothing but a political aberration, a last-ditched attempt to put the status quo genie back in the bottle and protect some semblance of our nation’s foreign policy and political consensus.</p>
    <p>&emsp;All these efforts failed, and now, we find ourselves in a new kind of DC, where <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2025/01/30/curtis-yarvins-ideas-00201552">once-taboo</a> opinions and ideas are beginning to boil to the surface. Unimaginable changes have occurred and are still occurring virtually every single day. Agencies have been lost and buried, policies gutted and killed, and services weaponized and cut. Within foreign policy circles, the change is quite severe, and is quite likely <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/07/19/aspen-forum-attendees-admit-theres-no-return-to-a-pre-trump-world-order-00464338">generational</a> in its impact and reach. Luckily for me, I’ve been able to document these occurrences firsthand to see how our country’s age-old foreign policy circles are holding up.</p>
    <p><b>The Vibes-Based International Order</b></p>
    <p>&emsp;The protests, election results, and collapsing consensus which have been occurring since 2016 have indeed had effects on our nation’s foreign policy networks and institutions. Within the second Trump administration, fights over foreign policy and its likely consequences have happened <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/05/01/mike-waltz-signal-group-chat/83386583007/">front and center</a>, with various figures openly stating their <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5211520-vance-trump-admin-plans-bomb-houthis-i-just-hate-bailing-europe-out-again/">frustration</a> about ongoing interventionist policies. Trump’s actions abroad, while sometimes hawkish, have often leaned toward cautious restraint and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/05/pentagon-national-defense-strategy-china-homeland-western-hemisphere-00546310">homeland defense</a>, such as with the president’s recent policies toward Israel and China. </p>
    <p>&emsp;When hawkishness has taken effect, such as against Iran, those actions have been often <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/22/politics/trump-iran-strike-decision-inside">followed by</a> cautious comments about the need for peace and stability. It is seemingly only in the western hemisphere where Trump’s personalism and love for William McKinley has derailed this trend, especially in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2025/10/31/trump-says-no-decision-has-been-made-on-looming-venezuela-land-strikes/">Venezuela</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/us-spy-agencies-told-gather-intelligence-greenland-rcna205982">Greenland</a>. </p>
    <p>&emsp;The onus is now not on the administration to convey how aggressive or militaristic it is, but to largely show a kind of political logic which always tilts back toward concerns for peace and America’s domestic interests. Of course, this logic is not always <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-iran-israel-maga-republicans-truth-2d240dc778494948d1b6d15977bec6d4">cohesive</a>, especially given Trump’s leadership style, but among the many up-and-coming foreign policy and intellectual figures within the GOP, the incentives have become clear: Restraint and neo-isolationism are where the cool chaps now <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href=https://ecfr.eu/article/j-d-vances-foreign-policy-when-restraint-meets-culture-war/">play</a> and conspire.</p>
    <p>&emsp;But there’s more to this story of changing conservative foreign policy, and to better understand these complex developments, I decided to engage in a series of conservations at conferences, cocktail hours, and famous MAGA bars throughout the summer and fall.  </p>
    <p>&emsp;Among the many younger conservatives I conversed with, many were quite sympathetic to various strands of national conservatism and traditionalism. While speaking to Republican congressional staffers, who wished to remain anonymous, at a local MAGA-friendly bar, I was able to learn quickly about the kind of new ideological environment these professionals were operating in. </p>
    <p>&emsp;The staffers decried what they viewed as a society which had drifted away from fundamental values, one in which hedonism and consumption were now supplanting long-held beliefs around God, the family, and community. Cultural others and elites were also an important point of contention.</p>
    <p>&emsp;“We’re funding him”, claimed one staffer, referring to billionaire George Soros. “Soros is taking our tax dollars through these international orgs, and we must stop it. And you kind of see this being done in Hungary. How about that Orban guy? So cool”.</p>
    <p>&emsp;This kind of sentiment was quite popular, as was Orban’s slew of conservative policies in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.npr.org/2025/05/29/nx-s1-5399682/hungary-trump-viktor-orban-cpac">Hungary</a>, with several staffers and figures harkening the country’s conditions to our own. Many lamented our country’s economic elite and decline and argued that our culture had become corrupted by cabals of liberals and globalists who were hellbent on holding onto power. Tirades against liberalism and wokeism were common, as were comments about protecting community and faith from opposing forces. Far from just being a partisan talking point, this admiration for Hungary, and its national conservative ideals, seemed to be quite authentic, with Orban’s style of politics serving as a model for what these professionals want to build here.</p>
    <p>&emsp;One staffer, while sipping on a Guiness, likened Orban’s politics to internal battles in America, describing our country’s historical trajectory as being “a story between lions and scavengers”, where “Lions build their community and scavengers are nothing but freeloaders.” In this analogy, Orban and conservatives were the lion, and the scavengers were the liberals, academics, and cultural elites who were trying to destroy both countries through means of population replacement and transgenderism.</p>
    <p>&emsp;The role of oligarchs and economics was also quite interesting, with positions often being both pointed and contradictory. “These billionaires suck, they’re all liberals”, said another staffer while rocking in his chair. “These billionaires have a social and moral obligation to help us, not the freeloading scavengers. And that’s why we like these few conservative oligarchs. They don’t want power. They’re actually losing money right now by serving our country. They’re real patriots”.</p>
    <p>&emsp;Various additional opinions were voiced about our nation’s conservative economic elites. At another bar, one conservative foreign policy wonk, while pointing to Gilded-age pictures he had saved on his phone, openly praised our country’s 19th century trusts, describing John. D Rockefeller's Standard Oil as being “smart and efficient”. Other thoughts were far less clear, with billionaires serving both as punching bags and as esteemed models. It was here where ideas and end goals became less clear.</p>
    <p>&emsp;Economic policy seemed to be far more wishy-washy. Welfare recipients were freeloaders, but America’s working class needed government support and aid. Government intervention was bad, but Trump’s tariffs and ownership stakes were sound policy. Often, these conversations turned into long-winded speeches about culture, where economic problems, such as inequality and wage stagnation, were to be solved through the nuclear family and male breadwinning. Chats about wealth concentration also ended up being far more concerned with the oligarch’s thoughts on gay and trans people than their actual influence on foreign policy and the broader economy.</p>
    <p>&emsp;Regarding deeper thoughts about foreign policy visions, several policy wonks described to me a swamp which was captured and soulless. They vociferously clamored for restraint and realism, and for a Republican Party which would fight for traditionalism at home while opposing foreign entanglements abroad. Noticeably, they opposed aid to both Ukraine and Israel, likening American aid to these countries as bleeding our country of its resources. </p>
    <p>&emsp;Supporting American interests and based realism, alongside other similar phrases, was seemingly the new cool kid on the block. Restraint, anti-interventionism, and guarding our own hemisphere, was, at least on paper and rhetorically, the new savvy vision behind America’s global purpose. Supporting once heterodox ideas on both foreign and domestic policy, such as Orban’s Hungary or anti-interventionism, beyond just conveying intelligence, was now to be worn like a badge of honor, proudly signaling to others one’s virtue and opposition to the liberal status quo and its ills. </p>
    <p>&emsp;The vast majority of interviewees were ultimately mixed in their ideals, borrowing their opinions from nationalists and free-marketers alike. During conversations at a foreign policy conference, in particular, this kind of mix and match foreign policy ideas found itself becoming more and more clear to me. </p>
    <p>&emsp;Restraint, isolationism, economic nationalism, and a variety of other points were all extremely popular, but beyond the rhetoric and passion, many were still unwilling to denounce Trump’s irrational behaviors overseas, or his deviations from their restraint-oriented worldview. Restraint was also likely to be quickly eschewed in certain cases, such as with Trump’s strikes against Iran and Venezuela, both of which were praised. Some hardliners disagreed and criticized the actions, but most were more than willing to follow Trump and his oscillations. </p>
    <p>&emsp;Forming less a cohesive ideology and more a coalition of competing vibes and individuals, today’s young conservatives conveyed to me a DC foreign policy environment which is now far more fluid, online, and transactional. The gravitational pull in this environment is undoubtedly more restraint-oriented and populist than years prior, but the salient place of Trump’s personality, and of cold hard cash and clicks, cannot be ignored. Whether it was owning the libs, racking up based opinions, or just bragging about what podcasts you listened to, the onus of the ideas and goals seemed far less ideologically structured and far more based in engaging in cultural and political affectations. </p>
    <p>&emsp;And these affectations can seemingly be willing to change depending on funding streams. Various MAGA influencers and figures were recently given a fully-paid <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-07-20/ty-article/.premium/israel-foreign-ministry-to-fund-visit-by-maga-social-media-influencers/00000198-26ec-d55c-a1be-7eee75e40000">trip</a> to Israel which was, in no unspoken terms, a pure and simple propaganda tour. The same can be said of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.wired.com/story/right-wing-influencers-are-turning-to-foreign-affairs/">Hungary</a> and Russia, which for years have attempted to build a popular base among conservative audiences in America. Famously, it was <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/russian-money-was-funneled-right-wing-creators-trump-media-outlet-pros-rcna169611">revealed</a> last fall that several influential conservative podcasters and commentators had been duped into accidentally forming connections to Russian oligarchs. Even many of DC’s legacy <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2025/01/03/foreign-money-think-tanks-00196252">think tanks</a>, operating as vestiges of our decayed foreign policy consensus, are now flush with foreign cash and opportunities, only further gutting what’s left of their legitimacy. </p>
    <p>&emsp;Thus, rather than being uniform in its ideology, conservative foreign policy, especially among Gen Z, has settled into a tepid position, propped up by transactionalism edicts from the glorious leader, and by an ambiguous opposition to foreign entanglements and liberalism. It is an ideology that has no clear endpoint, serving as a momentary stick of glue which helps to keep the various elements of the Republican professional class happy and content. </p>
    <p>&emsp;Only time will tell how this new milieu in DC handles itself once Trump leaves office, or even when Trump engages in future activity which likely contradicts the general vibes held by these young professionals. Most do not openly want flagrant wars or broad US engagement with international actors, but in today’s chaotic world, both things are still quite on the table. </p>
    <p><b>The Democrats' Tea Party Bonanza</b></p>
    <p>&emsp;The vibes among Democratic operatives and foreign policy professionals were atrocious. Following their November defeat to Donald Trump, many Democrats found themselves operating without hope or any kind of end goal. They were adrift, watching in horror as institutions like USAID and various other humanitarian organizations were raised, closed, and subsequently turned into Spirit Halloweens. Many were also pissed, filled with rage against an establishment which had again lost to someone who was described as existential to the nation’s democracy. </p>
    <p>&emsp;Joe Biden was obviously very unpopular among these individuals, but so was Kamala Harris and her tepid campaign. Many talked endlessly about what could have been done to correct the monumental failure, such as going back and doing open primaries, having someone seriously contend Biden, or maybe even convincing Harris’ team to shift more towards populism in the weeks prior to November. All were in vain. Every swing state, both chambers of Congress, and the Supreme Court were all now controlled by Republicans. It was, by all intents and purposes, the end of the world.</p>
    <p>&emsp;By the summer and fall of 2025, after the world did in fact carry on, I held various follow-up chats with figures operating in DC. Some were new graduates, others worked in think tanks and political offices, and many were now employed in areas other than their field of study.  Interestingly, our conversations in coffee shops and fun little speakeasies often diverged from foreign policy. Obviously, there were still intense feelings about the catastrophes in Gaza and Ukraine, and elsewhere, but moving from these terse chats, what we ended up talking about the most was the future of the Democratic Party. </p>
    <p>&emsp;Debates ensued over Ezra Klein’s and Derek Thompson’s new book Abundance and what it meant for the party, as did excited conversations over Zohran Mamdani’s victory in the New York City mayoral primary. Throughout countless conversations, we chatted about what the party could do, economically, politically, and socially to appeal to working class people who clearly were not buying our party’s particular brand or vision. It was a series of conversations defined by growing resentment and debate over what the hell the future of the party would be like, and as we moved closer to the fall of 2025, these conversations became sharper. </p>
    <p>&emsp;Abundance debates gave way to growing optimism around Mamdani and a growing dissatisfaction with the Democratic establishment and its leadership. “Schumer and Jefferies fucking suck man”, exclaimed one anonymous foreign policy wonk while sipping on a cocktail at an English themed Speakeasy. “Trump is going to singlehandedly launch an illegal war in Venezuela and Dem leadership is saying practically nothing. What’s even the fucking point of being the opposition?”</p>
    <p>&emsp;Similar sentiment was felt across a wide swath of conversations. “I think it came out the other day that the Dems were giving <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.wired.com/story/dark-money-group-secret-funding-democrat-influencers/">thousands of dollars</a> a month to liberal influencers and podcasters”, said one anonymous congressional staffer while laughing. “What are we getting out of this? Who is this for?”</p>
    <p>&emsp;Others expressed anger at the party for being both feckless and unable to distinguish themselves from Trump’s foreign policy. “How many of them [Democratic senators] met with Netanyahu?”, said an anonymous professional over coffee who works in consultation and policy. “How many of them have remained silent about Palestinians being detained and disappeared for speaking out against Israel? This shit is hard to defend, and we as a party should be bringing this front and center”.</p>
    <p>&emsp;Emerging among Democratic foreign policy professionals, I noticed a growing and palpable anger against the status quo. Less a cohesive vision for foreign or domestic policy and more a broad feeling of anger, Democrats are now finding themselves in an internal civil war over the future of the party. Fundamentally, the party is seemingly experiencing internal battles which are attempting to establish new principles and beliefs. </p>
    <p>&emsp;“What do we actually fucking believe in?”, said a progressive foreign policy analyst with years of experience in the think tank world. “If we believe in human rights, we have to actually defend them. If we support economic equality, we have to fight and defend it. Nothing is being said or done really. It’s disgraceful. For the love of God, we as a party just need to do something that tells people that the world isn’t going to be a lawless place where might makes right and dumbasses can get what they want through missiles and bullets”. </p>
    <p>&emsp;For a recent historical analogue, the Democrats are experiencing their own little tea party rebellion. Obviously there are key differences, such as the fact that progressive and liberal rebels are not <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/koch-brothers-fortune-power-conservative-crusade-american-politics-2019-8">funded</a> by dark money or right-wing billionaires. But in key races and debates, there seems to be an ever-widening divide between party favorites and outsiders. It is a division between Platner and the Miller, Mamdani and the Cuomo, and legacy outlets and independents. It is fundamentally a divide which is establishment vs anti-establishment, and much like the Republicans, the situation is rather fluid and could tilt in either direction.</p>
    <p>&emsp;The gravitational pull, however, stemming from interactions with both young Democratic professionals and members of the base, are likely leaning toward some variation of anti-establishment populism. How this populism will specifically impact foreign policy is open to debate. Certain fundamental principles, such as supporting democracy, human rights, and international cooperation, will remain firm. Providing support for Ukraine, and for our European partners against Russia’s gray-zone interferences will also likely receive strong backing. But among the rest of the dossier, lots of areas are now up for grabs. </p>
    <p>&emsp;Israel and Gaza will be an area of contention, as will growing opposition to AIPAC and its influence over Democratic primaries. Opposition to hawkish policies against China, Iran, and Venezuela will also grow. The role of economics and development will also loom large, with key questions around healthcare, childcare, and housing likely to grow exceedingly important as the economy falters and as inequality continues to skyrocket. </p>
    <p>&emsp;By and large, the Democrat’s current vision for the global order is currently vaguely center left. Many policies and principles are being contested and debated alongside a base and professional class which is pissed off and full of resentment. The situation is tenuous, and in the coming years, it is one which will experience an enormous amount of change as public anger and momentum begins to flow downstream to the channels and networks which make up the Democratic Party and its leadership.</p>
    <p><b>Let's Make It Happen</b></p>
    <p>&emsp;Both parties and their young professional classes are fluid and in search of change. Both groups, through different means, strategies, and networks, have read the writing on the wall that our country’s democratic system is sending off signals and have attempted to react accordingly. But unlike years past, our nation’s foreign policy consensus in DC is indeed shifting. </p>
    <p>&emsp;Trump’s foreign policy is personalist in effect and restraint-minded in rhetoric. He ran on peace and has continuously framed himself as the peace guy. In practice, however, he has bombed Iran, Venezuela, and Yemen. Trump is not ideologically strict, nor are his most sycophantic supporters, and because of this, the potential for future change to this structure is quite high. The same holds partially true for the Democratic establishment. While adhering to certain fundamentals, the party’s future vision for foreign policy is still largely contested and ambiguous. Both parties in our country are institutional weak and feckless; both could collapse rapidly following any kind of emerging crisis or election. Thus, now is not the time to wallow in sadness or despair. Instead, we must recognize this moment as an opportunity for change. </p>
    <p>&emsp;What is currently fluid can eventually become ossified and cemented through various forms of politics. It could be ossified into something dark and authoritarian, or into something which eschews inequality and discrimination. We truly are in a time where institutional decay and resentment have delivered us to a political environment where change, despite seeing far off, is actually quite possible. Now is the time to resist and fight, to throw off the shackles of our old foreign policy consensus and supplant it with something more democratic and more representative of our country as a whole. But until we declare our will to fight, this will not occur. We will simply watch from the sidelines, hoping for the best but clearly expecting the worst.</p>
