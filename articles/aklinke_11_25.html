    <h3>Utilize the Underutilized</h3>
    <p style="text-align: center;">A fundamental flaw in how we view transit.</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><em>by Andrew Klinke</em></p>
    <!--article contents: for each paragraph, tabbed in and separated slightly-->
    <p>&emsp;We like to believe, as a society, that we learn from our mistakes, but too often, our modern world still tends to repeat the past. If your news feed is tailored to transit, many of the headlines you may be seeing lately tend to sound far more like the Medieval days of American Transit in the 1960s and 1970s, with proclamations of funding shortfalls and service cuts abound. However, the most striking parallel to the era when Senator Grassley was considered only middle-aged has been the systematic mothballing, if not outright removal, of dedicated transit infrastructure in our cities. However, this time around, we are not removing old, poorly maintained infrastructure; we are instead abandoning newly built high-quality infrastructure barely a decade after completion. The removal of such modern infrastructure so soon after completion represents a worrying trend among municipalities across the nation, characterized by short-sighted policy and a fundamental misunderstanding of how to handle struggling transit systems.</p>
    <p>&emsp;The Minneapolis-St. Paul region (Twin Cities) and Washington, DC, are two of the most surprising places we find this trend occurring. The Twin Cities have begun the process of closing their sole commuter rail line, known as the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://kstp.com/kstp-news/top-news/committee-votes-to-suspend-northstar-commuter-rail-replace-with-bus-service/">Northstar</a>, which will end service on January 4th. DC will follow early next year with its Streetcar service along <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://wtop.com/dc/2025/10/dc-streetcar-service-to-end-in-2026-a-year-earlier-than-originally-planned/">H Street</a>, which is expected to end in March of the following year. Both of these systems are perfect examples of the short-sighted approach to handling struggling transit across America.</p>
    <p>&emsp;The Twin Cities region is often idealized for its forward-thinking transit, bike, and housing policies, making its most recent decision to close the North Star commuter rail line even more surprising. Initially proposed by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://mdl.mndot.gov/_flysystem/fedora/2024-08/commuter-rail-system-plan.pdf">Governor Jesse Ventura</a>, the commuter rail service was envisioned to run between downtown Minneapolis and St. Cloud, with seven intermediate stations, and terminate just north of St. Cloud in Rice, Minnesota. However, this project was <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.dot.state.mn.us/passengerrail/reports/northstar-rod.pdf">scaled back</a> to Big Lake, Minnesota, due to concerns that it would not receive the expected amount of funding from the federal government. The plan was to split the project into two phases, with the second phase extending to St. Cloud and Rice. The Minneapolis to Big Lake segment was scheduled to open in 2009 as the initial operational segment (Remember this term for later).</p>
    <p>&emsp;Ridership peaked for the Northstar in 2017 at 793,796. Since then, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.metrotransit.org/performance">ridership stagnated</a> and then dropped significantly with the pandemic, with ridership never really recovering afterwards, reaching a high post-pandemic of 127,400. The failure to recover ridership post-pandemic is partly because frequencies never returned to their pre-pandemic levels, largely because of a lack of funding. Ridership also struggled post-2014 due to North Dakota's oil boom, creating more freight traffic on the line from the host private railroad, Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF), creating delays. These factors, among others, led the Metropolitan Council to cancel service on the Northstar in August 2025.</p>
    <p>&emsp;The DC streetcar began life around the same time as the Northstar in the early 2000s. Initially proposed and studied in 2002, the District of Columbia <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/2002/10/06/dc-assesses-self-propelled-train/c814f5b6-8407-4798-8957-803d88f437fb/">envisioned</a> a streetcar system running throughout the district to provide a higher-order yet local service for its residents and fill gaps that the DC Metro missed. An initial line along the southern side of the Annocaosita River was planned; however, issues with the freight rail company CSX, which owned the right-of-way this line intended to use, along with increased costs, led to the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/01/AR2009040103937.html">delay</a> and eventual <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/city-fails-to-make-good-on-promise-to-open-streetcar-project-by-end-of-year/2014/12/31/383381a2-90f9-11e4-a412-4b735edc7175_story.html">cancellation</a> of this line. Once again, we see the trend of private freight rail being a hindrance to public transportation; however, this is best addressed in a future article. This led to the second line in development along H Street becoming the initial operational segment, there it is again, of the DC Streetcar. The H Street corridor was selected as it was identified by city officials that the streetcar could revitalize the corridor and would form the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.bizjournals.com/washington/news/2017/10/03/d-c-streetcars-benning-road-extension-moves.html">backbone</a> of a much larger east-west line in the city. The H Street line <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/dc-streetcar-makes-its-first-voyages-on-h-street-is-it-really-happening/2016/02/27/bd0c3234-dd5b-11e5-891a-4ed04f4213e8_story.html">opened</a> in 2016 after a multitude of delays and controversies related to both the construction of the line and the rolling stock, meaning the streetcars, purchased for the line. </p>
    <p>&emsp;After the service launched, ridership increased until it reached its peak in 2019, with 1,185,571 million riders. This would see a sharp <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://dcstreetcar.com/riders-guide/ridership-report/">decline</a> during the pandemic; however, it would recover to 853,455 thousand riders by 2024. A multitude of extensions were proposed for the starter line on H Street, including towards Georgetown in the west and further towards Benning Road in the East; however, neither materialized. The system struggles with constant delays due to parked cars blocking the tram tracks and a lack of dedicated right-of-way (ROW). The system has also faced criticism for poor <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://dcstreetcar.com/plan-your-trip/schedules/">frequency</a> running only every 15 minutes for the majority of the day, making it difficult to compensate for delays.  After barely less than a decade of active usage, the DC city officials elected to begin shutting down the streetcar due to city budget cuts.</p>
    <p>&emsp;While the mode of transit and location of these transit systems are different, they share a remarkably similar narrative. Both the Northstar and the DC Streetcar were underdeveloped, and the systems at inception were never meant to be successful without additional improvements that were never made. We see these systems described as initial operating segments of what were meant to be a part of much more comprehensive networks. However, in both cases, even their so-called initial operating segments were scaled back, the government staff planning and designing these systems knew they would never be successful in the long term without additional improvements. After their creation in both cases, politicians showed remarkably little effort in attempting to secure funds to proceed with these expansions and improvements that justified their existence. Even smaller improvements, such as the issue of frequency, were never addressed and were even made worse on both systems post-COVID, creating more issues for the systems and hurting ridership. </p>
    <p>&emsp;It is still somewhat interesting to note that officials for both the Northstar and DC Streetcar systems appear fairly unhurried after the completion of the first phases of their systems to pursue expansion. Generally, hoping for whatever scraps of money the federal government finds behind the couch for transit is sent to their agencies to fund expansion that never materializes. But also seemingly entirely unwilling to find funds for their own budget for these expansions, instead showering endless road projects and pointless prestige projects instead. </p>
    <p>&emsp;Then, once budgets became tight or other prestige projects became more attractive, state and local officials quickly looked to their ailing transit systems as something to offload, freeing up space. Officials then, citing poor ridership, proceeded to announce the closure of both systems, conveniently leaving out that it was their poor policy and lack of ambition that doomed these systems, with only vague, unfunded replacements that will most likely never materialize. Now, leaving many communities along both lines underserved by transit and billions of tax dollars wasted.</p>
    <p>&emsp;These two narratives show a fundamental flaw in how we handle struggling transit systems in America. Too often, we would rather cut our losses and move on rather than fix the systemic problem with our transit systems. We need a fundamental mindset change when we struggle with transit lines, from asking ourselves "how do we close this as soon as possible" to "how can we improve this line as soon as possible". Imagine if we fully funded the extension to St. Cloud instead of closing the system, or in the case of the DC streetcar, perhaps funding an extension to the upcoming Washington <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href=https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/transportation/dc-stadium-proposal-raises-questions-about-getting-there/3901531/">Commanders</a> stadium. Rarely do we look at highways and never build new ones, and instead consider tearing them down if not enough people are using them. Instead, we build more roads around them with things on the road for people to go to. If we had the same mindset of making underutilized transit more utilized rather than closing it, we could go a long way toward reducing car dependency in America.</p>
    <p>&emsp;This is a mindset shift that needs to happen soon if we want to succeed in creating a nation that is less car-dependent, and in an era where most cities are facing tightening budgets, we need to stay firm on our commitment to improving transit, not cutting back. The Northstar and DC streetcar are not the only systems in their infancy that require investment to become truly useful. Milwaukee, Wisconsin, is currently facing a similar question: whether to save or cut its streetcar line. However, the difference is that we can still save Milwaukee and others across the nation if we make active efforts and plans to improve these systems to their full potential rather than cut.</p>
